*Cryptocurrency hacks list from January 2021 - updated weekly.* 

"At this rate, 2022 will likely surpass 2021 as the biggest year for hacking on record. So far, hackers have grossed over $3 billion dollars across 125 hacks" - Chainalysis, October 12, 2022 via Twitter

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has labeled October 2022 as “the biggest month in the biggest year ever for hacking activity” with the total hacked value for the month nearly reaching $718 million.

Despite not being more than halfway through the month, Chainalysis said 11 different hacks on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols had seen hundreds of millions exploited.

The biggest target for hackers is cross-chain bridges, with three bridges targeted this month accounting for 82% of October’s losses. According to Chainalysis, the largest of these bridge hacks was a roughly $100 million exploit in the bridge between crypto exchange Binance’s BNB Smart Chain and Beacon Chain.
